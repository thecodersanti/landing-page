                    <div class="para">Upon discussing his inspiration for <em>The Bourne Identity</em> in 1984, Robert Ludlum shared a rather bizarre story. As he told it, the author was so joyful about getting his first novel, The Scarlatti Inheritance, published in 1971, that he inexplicably blacked out. When he finally came to, he was unable to remember where he had been or what he had done for the past twelve hours. It was a crucial experience in Ludlum’s life, as the notion of being completely in the dark led him to create the character of Jason Bourne.</div>

Serendipitously meeting while he was on the run, the pair found a kinship that eventually blossomed into romance. As a result, any smiling on the part of Bourne can be directly chalked up to Marie’s charming innocence.</div>

The former, also referred to as “Arnis de Manó (“harness of the hand”), is a Filipino Martial Art that emphasizes simplicity and power.</div>
